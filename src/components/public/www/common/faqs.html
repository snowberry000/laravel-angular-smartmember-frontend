				What's the difference between Lite and Standard?
			</a>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Each product has a 'Lite' plan and a 'Standard' plan. For teams that are smaller or are
					new to Smart Member, the 'Lite' plan offers fewer features. You can upgrade or downgrade
					between a product's 'Lite' and 'Standard' plans at any time.

				How do you define 'People'?
			</a>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Pricing for each product is based on the number of 'People' tracked in Smart Member. There
					are two types of 'People' - 'Leads' and 'Members'.
				</p>

				<p>A 'Lead' is a unique visitor to your website that provides you with their email address in
					some way - such as submitting an email optin form. You need our Smart Sites product to
					create optin forms and custom pages to make this easier.
				</p>

				<p>A 'Member' is typically a registered user of your web or mobile app that logs in. If a
					'Lead' signs up to your product (and the cookie we use to track them is present in the
					browser) they then become a 'Member' in Smart Member.
				</p>

				<p>'Leads' and 'Members' can be imported via CSV. You can delete 'Leads' and 'Members' at any time.</p>

				How is pricing calculated when my 'People' count changes?
			</a>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Your price can increase or decrease based on the total number of tracked 'People'
					increasing or decreasing.
