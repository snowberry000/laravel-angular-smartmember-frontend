<p>
	Smart Member would like to share with our user community, as well as those who may be contemplating asking Smart Member to disclose user data, our policies on responding to such requests:
</p>

<ol>

	<li>
		Because Smart Member is a service provider to other businesses, requests for user data should be referred in the first instance to a team owner or administrator. If you send a data request to Smart Member and the data is accessible to the team or user, we will start by forwarding your request so it's best to start there first.
	</li>

	<li>
		Smart Member provides prior notice to impacted team owners, administrators, or, where appropriate, individual site members, when legal process is received in criminal or civil matters and such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law or where Smart Member determines in its sole discretion that providing notice could create a risk of harm to specific people, to children or to Smart Member's rights and property interests including the security of its network.
	</li>

	<li>
		Smart Member requires that any individual issuing legal process to Smart Member properly domesticate the process and serve Smart Member in a jurisdiction where it is resident or has a registered agent to accept service on its behalf.
	</li>

	<li>
		Smart Member does not accept legal process directly from law enforcement entities outside the U.S. or Canada.  Foreign law enforcement agencies should proceed through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other diplomatic or legal means to obtain data through a court where Smart Member is located.
		Smart Member responds to legal process in a manner consistent with the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2501 et seq., and relevant case law.  Smart Member does not disclose account content absent a search warrant in criminal cases.  In civil cases, Smart Member cannot disclose content without sufficient legal process and the consent of the appropriate Smart Member customer(s).
	</li>

	<li>
		Team owners and administrators have flexibility to configure the content for their sites. For more information on the types of data that Smart Member collects and for how long such data is retained, please see: <a ui-sref="public.www.policy.privacy">http://www.smartmember.com/policy/privacy</a>
	</li>

	<li>
		Content removal requests should be directed to team owners or administrators.  As described in <a ui-sref="public.www.policy.tos">Smart Member's Terms of Service</a>, there are certain limitations on the appropriate use of Smart Member and Smart Member reserves the right to remove content that violates its policies.  However, these decisions are better made in most cases by the team owners rather than Smart Member.  Smart Member does remove images involving sexual exploitation of children and report such images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Smart Member publishes a <a ui-sref="public.www.policy.transparency">Transparency Report</a> summarizing user data requests and content take down requests.
